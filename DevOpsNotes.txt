Maven....
I want to load those files in to a project which is created in maven
Then both project faces should be same like Servlet 2.3 or 3.0
Other wise it will not accept jar files

Requirement is to develop a project in maven
Then you need to mention arch type and servlet facet 
mvn........  here it self all are mentioned (Really pom.xml contents only)
After running the command the project is created 
and all the mentioned information is available in pom.xml
It will be checked in to svn then developers will work on it
arch type can not be changable at any cost and project facet 
also can be upgradable.
developers add the jar content to pomxml file 
this pom xml file is given to genkins

Read effective pom.xml to get more clarity which can not be editable
maven goals are clean.....after build deltes the target folder which is called build
verify checks the pom.xml  compile.....compile the source files and keep in target
folder by default we can change the location of source and destination files which
you can chage at pom.xml file
maven goal is 'package' which creates jar or war file
'install' moves war file to local repository folder

Spring boot it self is a maven project it gives maven pom xml file
